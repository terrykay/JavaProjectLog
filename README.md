project-log
===========

 A Java FX based application, developed using Netbeans 8.0.1 to store and analyse project logs during project development, based upon my experience of keeping project logs whilst
 studying computer science at degree level.
 
 Allows storing logs and times under user defined sections, with reporting for times spent.
